# CHIP-8-Emulator

<b>COPYRIGHT</b>: Goes to Austin Morlan, I mostly used his code from [his website & tutorial](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/).

Using C++, we are able to emulate inner workings of a simple CHIP-8.
Using SDL2, we get a graphical interface that renders everything correctly.

I won't go into detail & highly recommend you read Austin's tutorial, because it's much more detailed.

Built without problems on Windows 10/MinGW, you just need to supply correct arguments.

```bash
chip8emu.exe <Scale> <Delay> <ROM>
```
